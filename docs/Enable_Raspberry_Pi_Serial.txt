Allow pi user to read serial port
================================
Check the ownership of the device.

CODE: SELECT ALL
ls -l /dev/ttyAMA0
crw-rw---- 1 root tty 204, 64 Jul 16 19:44 /dev/ttyAMA0

Then add yourself to the group.

CODE: SELECT ALL
sudo adduser pi tty



Disable Serial Port Login
=================================
To enable the serial port for your own use you need to disable login on the port. There are two files that need to be edited

The first and main one is /etc/inittab
This file has the command to enable the login prompt and this needs to be disabled. Edit the file and move to the end of the file. You will see a line similar to

T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100

Disable it by adding a # character to the beginning. Save the file.

#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100

Disable Bootup Info
=================================
When the Raspberry Pi boots up, all the bootup information is sent to the serial port. Disabling this bootup information is optional and you may want to leave this enabled as it is sometimes useful to see what is happening at bootup. If you have a device connected (i.e. Arduino) at bootup, it will receive this information over the serial port, so it is up to you to decide whether this is a problem or not.
You can disable it by editing the file /boot/cmdline.txt

The contents of the file look like this

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait

Remove all references to ttyAMA0 (which is the name of the serial port). The file will now look like this

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait
